1: I have a small black and a medium black almost in a line left to right
0: i have 2 black ones that are to the left of all grey ones... the lower of the black ones is slightly bigger... the upper right one has 3 light ones to it's right
1: Yes I think that is the same. Lets choose the larger black one?
0: ok... it's left-most for you too?
1: It is more center for me but usually the views are just a little off.
0: yeah but there's no other dots to it's left?

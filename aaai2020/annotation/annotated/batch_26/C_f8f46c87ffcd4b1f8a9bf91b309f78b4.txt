0: do you see a really small medium grey dot?
1: I have huge black dot immediately below huge light grey dot
0: i see that, and a really small medium grey dot above the light grey and slightly to the left?
1: I don't see a small grey. My pair of huge dots are positioned near the top of my view, so if there is dot above, they are out of my circle
0: ok, so below the really dark dot, way to the left and below is another light grey dot, really large
1: yes, exactly
0: ok lets pick that really dark large dot

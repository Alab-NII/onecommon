0: do you have a very large black one on the right?
1: do u have a really large black dot? to the right of it a really light medium sized dot, and above it to the right is another really light dot, slightly smaller than the black one but larger than the other light grey dot
0: ummm i don't have any of those you describe. if your large black dot is on the left of more than one I don't have it. My very large black dot is furthest on the right... How about at about 10 oclock there's a med grey one with a small lighter one to it's lower right
1: ok lets pick the really large black dot

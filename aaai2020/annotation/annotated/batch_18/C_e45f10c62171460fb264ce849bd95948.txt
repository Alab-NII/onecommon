0: hello
1: Hi do you see two med-large size dots that are almost the same size vertical from each other. The top one is a darker gray and bottom is lighter
0: sort of, the top slightly darker dot is a little to the right of the lighter dot
1: Yes and to the right of the top one is a large black dot?
0: yes
1: which did you select... the top darker dot or the black one next to it?
0: i selected the darker grey on top, not the black one
1: great thanks

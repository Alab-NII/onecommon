1: I have 5 dots that are aligned almost vertically. The dot in the middle is the only black dot.
0: I don't see that. I have 2 black dots. But there is nothing above either of them.
1: Below one of the black dots, is there two medium sized dots, with the top one being light grey and the bottom one being medium grey?
0: Yes. Let's choose the light gray.

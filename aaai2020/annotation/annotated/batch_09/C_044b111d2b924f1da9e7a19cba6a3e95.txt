1: I have dark medium sized dots in a line but not next to each other?
0: do you have a cluster of 3? the lowest one is med/dark grey, the one above/to the right is smaller and darker grey, the one to the left of that and above is slightly larger than the darker one, and lighter than both, but smaller than the lower one
1: Yes I have that cluster also!
0: ok so shall we choose the small darkest one on the right of that cluster of 3?
1: sounds good friend!

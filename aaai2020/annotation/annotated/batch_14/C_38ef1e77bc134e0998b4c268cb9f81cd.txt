0: I see a black dot with a slightly larger black dot that is slightly diagonal from it
1: tiny light dot... off to it's lower right over an inch away is a BIT bigger black one, in line off to it's lower right is a med-grey one of same size
0: I think I see the tiny light dot with the slightly bigger black one
1: is the black one the same you described? is your second slightly larger one below it about an inch down to it's left?
0: yes
1: ok let's choose the smaller black one above your bigger one

1: We got a cluster of three dots in kind of a wide based triangle that is pointing toward the left. Go for the top one.
0: I don't see that
1: Alright, there is a dark black dot with a light grey dot below and to the left of it. Got that one ?
0: I don't see that one. Do the initial dots have a smallish dark grey dot above them. I have a column of three nearly vertical dark grey dots.
1: I think i got your column
0: Great. Shall we choose that top one?
1: Yes

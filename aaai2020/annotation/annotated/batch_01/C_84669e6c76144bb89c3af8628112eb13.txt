0: I have a lonely medium, light grey dot alone
1: I see one at the top near the edge
0: I have 2 near the edge
1: I see one right at the edge which is above a black dot
0: lets focus on those 2. they're both light grey but I think you have to look really close to see that one is slightly bigger
1: yes, I see two grey dots with a black dot between them on the left side of the circle
0: ok mines different. do you have 2 aligned vertically. One is darker grey and a bit bigger, and the smaller one to the left is smaller
1: not exactly vertical, small light grey is higher, larger medium grey is lower a bit to the right
0: ok i have something like that, lets choose the larger, light grey one?
1: ok

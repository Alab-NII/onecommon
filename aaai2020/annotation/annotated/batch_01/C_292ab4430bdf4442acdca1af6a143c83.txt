0: Hello! wheres your dot?
1: I see two dots vertical of each other, the top one darker and smaller than the bottom one
0: Doesn't look like I have that in my circle. How about a large medium shade dot to the left of a smaller light shade dot?
1: Is the large dot slightly higher than the smaller dot?
0: No its slightly lower. Probably not the same one. How about a large dark dot by itself with a small light dot to the north west of it?
1: I don't have that, but I see which one you were talking about before and we can go with the large medium shade dot
0: ok

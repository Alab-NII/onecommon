0: I see 5 dots that form a < sign.
1: o do not see that
0: I see a black dot. It is kind of big. Below that dot, to the left, is a light dot.
1: i see something similar to the lower right of the black one do you see a smaller dot that is the same color as the one you said was below the black one?
0: Yes. It is more or less lighter, but same size. They kind of form a triangle.
1: yes. i think we should choose the black dot

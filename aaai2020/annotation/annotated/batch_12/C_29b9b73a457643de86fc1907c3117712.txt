0: three dark dots forming a line? one in the middle is smallest and almost black?
1: 7 total dots. One is alone in the bottom left, then there are basically 3 sets of 2 aligned roughly vertically
0: in those sets is there a medium sized almost black one below a large dark grey dot? if so click that black one
1: No, the only black ones are on the ends. Left pair: small black above slightly lighter black. Middle: medium grey above smaller lighter grey. Right: medium dark grey above small black
0: Yes okay click the small black one!

1: I see a large dark gray, with a large light gray below and slightly to the left, and a smaller dark gray below and slightly to the right.
0: I don't have that. Do you see two dots the same size one black and one dark grey going diagonal ?
1: I think so. Is the lighter one below and to the right?
0: Yes! Which should we choose?
1: The lower gray one!
0: Okay!

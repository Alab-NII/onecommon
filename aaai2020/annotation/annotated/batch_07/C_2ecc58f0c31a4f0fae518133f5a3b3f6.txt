0: I see 3 dots grouped together in the bottom hemisphere
1: I don't see that.
0: Alright what about a light gray dot close to the edge of the circle
1: Is it a smaller dot or a larger dot?
0: It is smaller
1: I don't see that. I do see a small grey dot to the left of a large dark dot. For me, it's about a quarter of a way down, but not by any edges.
0: I think I have that one, is it closer to the middle of the circle? The big gray dot is much darker than the smaller one?
1: Yes, I believe that is it.
0: Let's click it?
1: The smaller, light dot, right?
0: right.
1: Okay!
0: Did you select it>?

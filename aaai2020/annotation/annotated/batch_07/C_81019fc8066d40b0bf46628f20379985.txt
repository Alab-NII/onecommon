1: do you have 2 light dots one being lower and to the right
0: Yes, but because of different orientations we may not be referring to the same dot? I have a very light dot that is pretty small
1: do you have 2 of them away from each other
0: My other light dot is across the circle
1: okay. mine too. do you wanna do the one that's furthest away from the other dots?
0: alright!

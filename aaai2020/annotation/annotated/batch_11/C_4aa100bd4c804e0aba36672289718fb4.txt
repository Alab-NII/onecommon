1: do you have 3 tiny ones with the top being darkest, and the bottom on the far right being lightest?
0: I see the dots, but to clarify, the bottom one is to the left?
1: no. the ones i see form a long triangle. instead - do you see two medium grey dots, they're medium/large - the right one is about 2 inches away from the other and up a little higher
0: Yes.
1: ok let's get the right one then, choose that :) ty

0: Do you see a group of three dots with two being about the same color and the third being bigger and darker?
1: do you have a black one? it's kinda small but not very... with the same size light one right below it? it may be the 3 you describe... if your lowest one is the smallest and further to the left?
0: I have that group, but it was not the one I was asking about earlier. Pick the darkest one of the three?

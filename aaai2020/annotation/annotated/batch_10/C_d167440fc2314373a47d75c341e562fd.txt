0: toward your bottom, do you have a large dark grey, with a light, smaller one right above it slightly to the left?
1: Yes! I there a nearby med sized and shade dot to the right?
0: if it's at all below them, i don't see that, bc my large dark grey one is touching the bottom of the circle edge. I do have a tiny black one way off to the upper right of the first 2 i described, above them about 2 plus inches away
1: Yes okay! click that tiny black dot!

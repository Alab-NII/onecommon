1: Name a dot
0: I see two light grey circles that are pretty close together. One is slightly larger than the other
1: in the center?
0: I don't know. Your center is different from what my center is.
1: really small black dot at 12?
0: No. Is the smaller of the light grey circles close to a large circle that is medium shade?
1: yes
0: Let's click that smaller grey one then.

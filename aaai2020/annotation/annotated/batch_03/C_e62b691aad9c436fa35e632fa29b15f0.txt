1: Do you see two fairly large dots close together? They are both pretty light grey. The one on the bottom is slightly smaller and to the right
0: hmmm no. i have 3 in a line going down/to the right. top one is dark, next one down to right is med/light grey and slightly larger, furthest right is slightly smaller and slightly darker than middle one but not as dark as left one
1: I think I see two of the three. I see the first two you described. The one on the top is is darker and slightly smaller, at about 10 oclock?
0: in line with that dark one, if you go straight down about 2 inches, is there a small lighter/med grey? lighter than the second one
1: Not on mine, that formation is at the bottom of my visible circle. I still think we're talking about the same thing. Lets go for the one on the top left. The dark one.
0: ugh i think that's the one i'm missing ... but i'll choose my dark one,

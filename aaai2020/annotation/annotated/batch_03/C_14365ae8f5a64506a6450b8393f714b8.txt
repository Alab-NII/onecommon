1: These dots are almost in a hook or question mark shape. Do you agree?
0: no, it doesn't look like that to me. if you see a dark grey tiny dot, is it close to a larger one?
1: I see 3 small dark dots. Two are near larger black ones...BUT one is near a large light grey. I think that is easier to identify. Do you see it?

1: I only see one dot that is lighter in color. Do you agree?
0: i see two lighter grey circles. do you see a really big dark grey circle surrounded by smaller and tiny circles?

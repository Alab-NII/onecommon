0: most of my dots are the same medium shade... but ONE is very large and much lighter.
1: i have all grey and light grey dots. one tiny grey dot on the right with a slightly larger light grey way above it (and to the right a bit). is the large one you have below about 4 dots?
0: the large one i see is below three (in my circle) and to the left of a very tiny dot
1: sounds good, lets hit the larger light one

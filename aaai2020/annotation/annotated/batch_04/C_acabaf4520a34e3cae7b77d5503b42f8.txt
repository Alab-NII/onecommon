0: in a cluster of dots forming a ziggy-line, the fourth one from the left is the lightest, medium sized
1: 5 of the 7 dots on close to each other in a semi-straight horizontal line on the top of the circle. I do have a small to medium dark-grey dot in the center of the circle and a medium med-gray dot diagonally to the bottom left of the other.
0: the 5 that form the line... is the second from right (4th from left) the lightest?
1: Yes, it is. Let's choose that one.

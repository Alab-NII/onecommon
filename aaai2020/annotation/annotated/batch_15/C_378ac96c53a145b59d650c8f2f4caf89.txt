0: I have a large black dot, with a much smaller, slightly lighter but still dark dot down and to the left
1: No you have a small black dot to the bottom right corner
0: I dont have a small black dot. Do you have two dots almost perfectly horizontal to one another? The one on the right is larger, darker and maybe a TINY bit higher. The left on is smaller side and medium grey
1: Yes lets choose top one
0: Ok, i'll choose darker, higher one on the right

1: I have large black dot right below and to the right of a very small light gray dot. They are very close to each other
0: No, do you have a largest sized black dot? If so click it
1: Ok I didn't see your first message... I think we are talking about the same two dots... is the light gray really close to the dark gray
0: Take the tiny grey one, you described it wrong then.

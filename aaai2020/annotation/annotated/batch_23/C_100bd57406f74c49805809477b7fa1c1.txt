1: on the right, large dark grey dot with a slightly smaller light gray dot above and to the left of it?
0: hmm on mine the light gray one is above and to the right not the left. must be different one. How about a medium light gray dot with another one the same to its lower left?
1: my bad, i meant to the right. i don't have the one you mentioned, but i think we should choose the light gray one above and to the right
0: ok if its to the right then it sounds correct now. lets pick that light gray one!

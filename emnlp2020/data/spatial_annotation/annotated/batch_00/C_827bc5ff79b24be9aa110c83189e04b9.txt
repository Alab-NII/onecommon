0: tiny black dot by itself?
1: I have one by itself but its at the bottom of my circle so it may be risky. anything you can tell me thats near it? I have a large darker grey one off to the far north west of it?
0: hmm no its all the way at the top of mine. do you have a triangle with one black dot that is the largest?
1: Yes i have that triangle, sounds like thats a safer option
0: k click on that black one all the way to the left

0: Two very dark ones right next to each other. One is slightly smaller and above/to the right
1: three darkest in a curvy line going down to right... yes your top one is the top of the 3... do you see the other that's further away below to the right?
0: Yes. It is lower to the right. To the direct right is a lighter one that is slightly larger. If that is the case let's pick the lower dark dot that is slightly to the right. Make sense?
1: yes the lowest dark dot?
0: Yes

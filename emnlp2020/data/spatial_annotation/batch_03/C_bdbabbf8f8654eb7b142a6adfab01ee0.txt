0: I have 3 differently shaded dots that form a triangle the lightest on the top point
1: i have 2 of about the same color right next to each other, the right one is slightly smaller, with a light one in between and above them both that's a little smaller still, but not tiny
0: lets pick the slightly smaller one on the right.
1: maybe we should pick the light one
0: ok

1: The largest dot here is the darkest
0: My largest one isn't the darkest -- I have a small black one. But I do have two very dark large ones - one is down and to the left of the other. The one on the right is black, and the one on the left is dark gray.
1: Let us select the one on the left that is dark gray
0: OK!

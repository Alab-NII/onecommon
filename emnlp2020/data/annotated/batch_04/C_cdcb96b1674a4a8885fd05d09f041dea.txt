0: they're all pretty spread out
1: All of my dots are pretty scattered as well. The three dots on the bottom left are in a diagonal going from left to right with a med-gray one on top, dark one in the middle and light-medium gray one on the bottom.
0: i think i'm missing the light/med grey bottom one... so let's choose your top one ... that one is smaller than the second/darker one right?
1: Yes, the med-gray one is slightly smaller than the dark-gray one.
0: ok let's choose the smaller one on top of that line

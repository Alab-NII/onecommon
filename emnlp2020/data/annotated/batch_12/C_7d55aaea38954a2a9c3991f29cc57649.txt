1: do you have a black kinda large one, with a med/grey one that's a little smaller to it's upper right?
0: yup! do you have a smaller one beneath those two?
1: smaller meaning tiny and med/grey? it's about over an inch below the black one?
0: that's the one! how about above those 2 about an inch up a light grey one about the size of the darker circle
1: no these are at the top of my circle. but to the right, directly in line but further away from the black one i have the same-size med/grey. so if you have that should we choose the black one?
0: Yes I have that one too. and I agree

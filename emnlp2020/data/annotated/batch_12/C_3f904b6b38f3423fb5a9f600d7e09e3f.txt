1: i have three dark grey dots in a triangle , the bottom dot is the largest
0: Is that largest one the medium shade between the light and dark gray other two?
1: no, it's maybe a bit darker than the other two and it's above a similar sized light grey dot
0: I don't see it.
1: ok, how about a very light grey small dot that doesn't have anything close on at least all sides but the right?
0: I see that one...Let's choose that one
1: yep yep

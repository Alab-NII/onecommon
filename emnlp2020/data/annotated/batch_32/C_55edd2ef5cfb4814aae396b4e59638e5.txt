0: big grey dot near bottom edge right hand side
1: we have different views so that doesn't help me really but I don't have any large dots...I have two smaller dots same shade diagonal from each other
0: towards the right hand side?
1: again...we have different views so what you see isn't where I see it necessarily. It is to the right of two darker gray small dots
0: yes
1: ok...choose the lower of the two light gray small dots

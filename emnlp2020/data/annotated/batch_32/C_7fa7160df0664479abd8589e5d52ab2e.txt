0: Small grey dot, almost directly below a larger darker grey dot
1: how close is it? I see a larger gray dot with a light gray tiny dot above it but we have different views so it could be the same one but it is really close above...
0: Damn close. The larger one is slightly, slightly to the right
1: yes...choose large one

0: Hello...in the very left of the circle in the middle I have a small dark grey dot with a larger dark grey dot above it and to the right
1: HI! Yes. i see that. they are a bit on their own.
0: yes it your small dark grey dot almost identically in the center of the circle on the left close to touching the edge but not quite?
1: our circles overlay differently. so i cant really use that to help us.
0: Ok well we're running out of time so I would say we pick that small grey dot
1: ok, i agree.

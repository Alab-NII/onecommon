1: I have one small light dot, do you also only have one?
0: darkest medium/small dot about 4 Oclock, almost at the edge?
1: I only have one small dark dot, but it isn't really at 4 o'clock. May be because we are looking at slightly different perspectives
0: the light/small one, i have only one also. its about 6 oclock, but almost an inch in from the edge?
1: Let's go with the small light one just because we are both certain of the size and color, and we both only have one.

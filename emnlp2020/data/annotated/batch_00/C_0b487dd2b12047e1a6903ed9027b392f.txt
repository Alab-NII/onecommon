1: do you have a tiny really-light one?
0: Towards the bottom around 7 oclock?
1: yeah it prolly would be for you... with a large dark one to the right/above?
0: Dont have the dark grey. The dot has to be in the same spot for both of us for it to count
1: they're not going to be in the same spot - the circles for each view are off=center of each other, with one dot non-inclusive for each of us, but 7 each
0: k done this like 10 times and the clock method always works but i guess pick the light grey and hope.

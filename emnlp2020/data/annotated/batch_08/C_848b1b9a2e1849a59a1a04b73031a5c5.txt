1: 3 dots together, smallest above, medium in between, and larger black on the bottom
0: I have a large dot alone at the top. Much lower and to the left is a tight cluster of 3 dots. Lower and to the right is another cluster of 3 dots but they aren't as close together.
1: the three tight cluster
0: Choose the dark one? Lowest corner?
1: yes

1: There is one small black dot, and there is a light a little bigger dot on top left of it
0: I dont have that. Two pairs of smaller dots almost identical in size and forming a diagonal line sloping up to the left?
1: is the one on the top lighter than the one on the bottom?
0: Yes its a very light grey. If so click that one!

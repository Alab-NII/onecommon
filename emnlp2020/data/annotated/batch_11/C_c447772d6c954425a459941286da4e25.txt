1: Large med/grey dot, with a small black one just to it's right? and a lighter one below them?
0: I dont have the lighter one but is that small black one slightly below the large one to the left of it?
1: well it's kind of in line with it... the tiny black one is in line with the bottom of the large med/grey one. I can't imagine u don't have the lighter one below the two of them.
0: I don't it sounds the same though. click the small black one!

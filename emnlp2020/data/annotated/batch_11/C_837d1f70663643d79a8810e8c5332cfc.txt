0: I don't have that. I have a very large black dot just to the left of a smaller dark gray dot. Do you have that?
1: I dont see that. I have 3 dots in a diagonal line near the bottom. Darkest to the right same size medium gray in the middle and a medium to light gray smaller to the left.
0: I don't see that. I do have one dot that is lighter than all the others, and is kind of by itself.

0: My circle is different, so things are in different places, but I think that is the same one.

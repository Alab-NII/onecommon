0: do you see any other dots around it?
1: No, but the edge of my circle is down and to the right of it, so there could be some that way. It also has a smaller, dark dot over at its 10 oclock. They are both pretty far away from it
0: the much smaller much lighter one, are there any close to that one?
1: Yes, there is a medium sized, slightly darker dot up and to the left
0: ok. i am going to choose the first dark dot that you mentioned.

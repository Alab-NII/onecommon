0: Do you have two small dots?
1: I see a large dark dot with a small dark dot below it, and a medium size lighter do above.
0: I don't see that on mine.
1: How about a large size, medium-gray dot kind of on it's own? (small dark dot above and to the right, but kind of far away)
0: I see that my large one is around the 11 o'clock position and smaller one is more near 12
1: That could be it. Want to try the large gray dot?
0: Lets do it

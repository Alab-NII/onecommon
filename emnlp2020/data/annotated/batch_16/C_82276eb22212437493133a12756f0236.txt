0: do you see two medium gray dots very close together where one looks to be slightly smaller than the large one?
1: And the smaller one is diagonally above the other to the west?
0: Yes
1: they are both in the lower half of the circle
0: we have different views so that doesn't help me but choose the larger of the two dots

1: I have a large dark gray dot above a slightly smaller black dot
0: I have a triangle of 3 larger dots (one light gray, med gray, and black) about the same size upper left. I don't think I have that.
1: I see the triangle is the black one on the right?
0: yes! With the lights down and to the left of the both other dots.
1: Great! lets pick the black one.

1: i have a dark black dot - small - at the 3 on a clock and touching the circle
0: Do you have a small black dot with a small grey dot reasonably far above it?
1: yes there's a very light small grey dot that is far to the left from that black dot
0: hmm. mine is only slightly to the left. What else do you see?
1: i have a medium light colored dot just to the right of where the 12 would be
0: Our views are different. Do you have a large black dot with a lighter medium dot to the upper right?
1: i know. the only black dot i have is small and touching the outer circle
0: Alright. Let's try that one?
1: ok

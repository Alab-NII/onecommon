1: I see three dots arranged almost vertically.
0: i have 4 med grey spread out along the bottom. middle one is darkest and smallest
1: I don't see that.
0: i don't see 3 vertical. what size/color and how far apart are they?
1: Actually, I see 4 med grey spread out, but they are along the middle of the circle
0: they kind of form a diamond if you connect the dots?
1: Not really, they are almost in a straight horizontal line. The darkest and smallest dot in the line is also the darkest and smallest dot among all of them.
0: it really doesnt sound the same. do you have a couple of really dark and small dots toward the top/left?
1: No, all of my dots are in the middle of the circle or below
0: lets try the smallest of the ones along the horizontal line
1: Ok

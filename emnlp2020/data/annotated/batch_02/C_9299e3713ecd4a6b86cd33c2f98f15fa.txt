0: Do you see a small lonely black dot? or a medium grey lonely dot?
1: Yes, is it towards the bottom of the circle?
0: Cant know if my bottom is your bottom remember our circles may not be aligned up. but the grey medium on mine has a dark grey about same size to the upper right of it . do yours have that?
1: I don't think so...are all of your other dots located above the lonely one?
0: my lonely black has 2 sets of 2 to upper left of it
1: I'm not seeing that...I have another dot that could be considered lonely that is slightly larger than the other one

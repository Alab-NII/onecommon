0: one black dot with a smaller dark grey to the right of it. I also have some other med/dark grey dots to the far right of those
1: I have a little black one too, but mine is at the very top, so there's nothing to the right of it. There is a dark gray dot that is down a little from it, and just a tiny bit to the right. And there's a larger medium gray dot down and to the left of it
0: okay thats not the one I was talking about but I do have those dots! :) lets pick the larger med grey dot you mentioned

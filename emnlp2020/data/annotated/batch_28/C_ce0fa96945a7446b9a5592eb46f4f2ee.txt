0: do you have a black dot? to it's immediate right below it is a lighter one almost same size. to it's left is a slightly smaller med/grey one that is almost an inch to it's left directly?
1: I have one, but mine is all the way at the left, so I don't have one to the left of it. Mine is kind of by itself.
0: is it larger? with a small grey one above it to it's right? then the black one that is smaller (the one i was talking about) is an inch across to the right of that
1: No, I think mine is different. I do have a smallish medium gray dot, with a slightly larger black one to the right of it and up just a tiny bit.
0: ok great let's pick the smallish grey one

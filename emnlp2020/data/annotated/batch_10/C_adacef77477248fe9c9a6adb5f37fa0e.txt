1: I have a smaller gray dot just above and to the right of a large black dot
0: Do they form a triangle with a medium dot that is the same shade as the small one?
1: Not that I can see, it is at the top of my screen though... off to the right of the large black dot there is a vertical line of three dots that kind of curves
0: Hmm not sure what you're seeing. Do you see two almost black dots very close together?
1: Larger one below the other?
0: Yes! Click the larger one!

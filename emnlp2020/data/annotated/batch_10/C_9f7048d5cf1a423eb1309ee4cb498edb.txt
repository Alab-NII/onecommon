0: A medium dark grey dot with a lighter grey slightly smaller one next to it on the right, slightly lower?
1: do you have 3 in a kind of a line, kinda small, left one is med/dark, middle is a little lower and lighter, right one is dark and almost even with the middle? Sounds the same, your two are the first 2 i describe...
0: yes i agree sounds the same, you want to pick the middle lighter one?
1: my thought exactly. picking light/middle

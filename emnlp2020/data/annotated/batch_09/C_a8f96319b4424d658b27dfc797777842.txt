1: hmmm my dots are all spread out. any one of them could be not yours. Is that large med grey one by itself on the far right? or do you have a smaller/darker one to it's right also?
0: There is a smaller darker one to the right, and a bit lower down...
1: oh great! me too ... shall we pick the large one?
0: yes!

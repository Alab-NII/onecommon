1: Large black with very tiny light grey up and to the left?
0: no. :( very very tiny very light grey dot?
1: Yes...but that one is near my large black. Maybe it is cut off from your view. Is there a set above your tiny grey that are on an angle to each other with the lighter one above a darker?
0: yes! click that very tiny light one!

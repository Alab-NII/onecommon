1: Very large black one with same size dark grey to it's lower right
0: Hmm I think the dark grey dot is cut out of my view. Does the large black dot have a small med grey dot up and to its right?
1: yes but you should see the large grey one too bc there is another tiny light dot past it to it's lower right , both can't be cut off for you, and no way to cut off the big one with out cutting off the tiny one... does your small one up to the right have a same-size above it to it's left?
0: Yes! But that dark grey one is def cut out! Click the large black one!

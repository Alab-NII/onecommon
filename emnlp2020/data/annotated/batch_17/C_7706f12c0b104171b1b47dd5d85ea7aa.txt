1: I have 2 dots at the bot left around the 7 o clock position one is larger darker touching the line. the other is smaller and light and just above it to the right.
0: do you have two small ones right next to each other? right one is a little higher and a little bigger?
1: I do have that to -- near the center of the circle?
0: yes, bc i think i only have your light 7 oclock one you mention. My small ones are dark. shall we choose the smallest/left one of my two?
1: ok is the one in the group you mentioned smaller and black? the other is dark gray and up (slightly) and to the right
0: ummm they both look black to me. let's choose your light 7 oclock one, the upper one of your 7 oclock pair

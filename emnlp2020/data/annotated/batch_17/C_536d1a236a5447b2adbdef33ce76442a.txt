1: Do you see a small dark dot towards the top?
0: Do you see a medium sized black dot, to the left and above is a light slightly smaller dot, and to the right and a bit lower is a small grey dot
1: Yes I do, I see the trio you speak of. Let's take the black medium one.
0: Yes, and word of advice, never tell your partner where your dot is in relation to your circle, always use other dots to describe. My circle is different from yours

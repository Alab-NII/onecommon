1: I have one dark black medium sized dot with a tiny light grey dot up and to the right at 1 oclock
0: Hmm... biggest dot on my screen is also lightest with a darker slightly smaller dot very close, about a centimeter away
1: My biggest dot is also very light, but I cant see down from it as its at the bottom of my circle. Does it have a small black dot horizontal to the left? The small black is slightly lower?
0: Lets go back to your first example actually its close to the middle, the small light grey one at 1'oclock
1: I mean 1 oclock relative to the black dot, not the circle.
0: Yep, and its the smallest dot I see and nearly the lightest too
1: Ok, lets go with the smaller lighter dot
0: Good luck!

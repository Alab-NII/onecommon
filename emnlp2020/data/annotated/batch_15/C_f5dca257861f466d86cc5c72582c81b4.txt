0: The darkest dot on my screen is nearly in the center for me
1: yes I see a larger light grey dot, not really a lot near it
0: Yeah tricky one since nothing is close, there are two very light ones down and to the left
1: Is one pretty large in size and lighter?
0: Theres actually two that fit that description so to be safe I saw the darkest one thats medium sized
1: Ok I will take the dark medium one. It is by far the darkest for me.
0: Same, good luck!

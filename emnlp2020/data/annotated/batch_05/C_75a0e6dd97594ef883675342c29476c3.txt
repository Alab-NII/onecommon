1: i see a long line of 5 dots on the left side, broken line, darkest dot 4th down
0: Is your darkest dot smaller than all the other ones?
1: yes, and below the lightest one that is slightly larger
0: I don't have anything below that! But I think we might be looking at the same thing. Above the darkest dot, is a light grey one, kinda to the left?
1: yes kind of to the left and the next dot up is about same size and darker grey to the right
0: Yes!
1: lets choose the darkest smallest dot then
0: Okay! Have a good day :)

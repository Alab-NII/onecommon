0: Do you see a small light grey dot with a larger, darker one above it and the the left?
1: do u see two large grey dots, in a diagonal from each other? almost same size?
0: I don't think I see what you see.
1: i see a small light grey dot, by itself on my left edge, the larger grey dot is below it and to the right
0: I see that. I think I see the diagonal you mentioned earlier now too
1: yeah below that larger one to the right is one thats maybe a little darker, and about the same size, below the higher of these two dots, and slightly left is a small darker dot too
0: I see the dot you mentioned at the top, but not the one at the bottom
1: ok lets try for the one we think we know of, the larger grey dot

0: do you have a med/light grey small one, kind of by itself - with a lighter, slightly small one all the way to it's right?
1: i see two dots close together. the higher one to the left is black and the lower to the right is slightly larger and it's lighter
0: i don't see them. are they on the bottom?
1: lower right quadrant of the circle. I do see a med/light grey small one but there is nothing anywhere around it. that one is in the lower left quadrant of my circle almost on the line.
0: yeah nothing near it... the lighter slightly smaller one is about 2-3 inches directly to it's right
1: i see that
0: ok shall we choose the light smaller one?
1: the tiny one you said all the way to it's right?
0: yes. there's a med/grey you said lower left quad of your circle. 2-3 inches directly to it's right is the smaller, lighter one. let's choose the smaller lighter one

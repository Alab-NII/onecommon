1: Five of my dots are on the left side of the circle. The other two dots are on the right with the top being a larger med-gray and the bottom one being a small dark dot.
0: I basically see the same. They are all in pairs with the exception of one large dark dot
1: Only two of my dots are in pairs. I have one pair on top that is horizontal with a darker one on the left, both about the same size. The second pair is below those with both being medium gray. The top one smaller than the bottom.
0: I have both of those as well, I would say maybe the darker one on the left in the pair of the same size
1: Sounds good.

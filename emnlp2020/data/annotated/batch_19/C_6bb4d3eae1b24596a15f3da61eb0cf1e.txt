1: do you see the smallest darkest dot at about 10 o clock
0: I think our circles are different but I have two small dark dots almost vertical from each other. The top one is off to the right.
1: i think i only see one of them, but if i see the bottom one, is there a slightly larger and medium grey dot below to the right of it?
0: I dont see that... do you have two large dots diagonal from each other with the darker one below and to the right?
1: yes!
0: Lets pick the bottom dark one.

1: i see two large dark grey dots near each other
0: I have a large black dot drifting alone. I see those too! The larger is to the left and lower
1: for me those are the same size, not one larger than the other. how about two really light grey dots near each other, horizontally almost.
0: Yes but one seems slightly bigger, but very small difference. the bigger one seems to be the one to the left
1: yeah, lets pick the one on the right
0: ok

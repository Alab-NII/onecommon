0: I have a large grey dot kind of by itself
1: No large gray dots by themselves for me. Do you have any small grays?
0: Yes. I have a line of three. The smallest is furthest right. The other two are down and to the left. They are a little bigger.
1: I just see 2 in 2 different locations. Maybe one of those is common. I have one medium gray and one lighter gray in both locations
0: Is the lighter one smaller and to the upper right?
1: Yes

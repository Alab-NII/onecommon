1: I got a larger mid grey dot on my right side. It's bigger than all the other dots. Above and to the left is a smaller but still quite big light grey dot. You got that one ?
0: Do you see two dark dots with the bottom one smaller and to the right of the top one?
1: I don't have your pair.
0: i'm not seeing yours either...how about two dots look to be same size...bottom one is black
1: I think i got that pair. Go for the bottom one!
